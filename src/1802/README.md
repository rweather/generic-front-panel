This directory contains driver code for 1802-based machines in "fp\_driver.s".

The "hello.asm" example scrolls "HELLORLD!" followed by the printable ASCII
characters across the display from right to left.

Press any key except RESET to stop the scrolling message.  Keys pressed
after that (except RESET) will be shown on the display, scrolling in from
the right.  This allows all keys on the keypad to be tested.  Press RESET
to start again with the scrolling message.
